- **EBIT and Margins:**
  
  Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) and EBIT margins showed robust growth until 2021, after which both metrics declined in 2022 and 2023. This fluctuation reflects changes in operational efficiency and market conditions.

- **Book Value and Dividends:**

- **Resolution Planning:**
  
  Goldman Sachs has engaged in resolution planning to ensure orderly resolution in the event of financial distress, addressing regulatory feedback to enhance governance and operational practices.
